Here we have raw and screened Mtb data with Bioactivity, collected fro m ChEMBL

# FOR Mtb ONLY
A dataset of inhibitors against Mtb (Target ID CHEMBL360) were compiled from the ChEMBL database that is comprised a total number of 88,284 compounds and 169144 bioactivity data points. The initial data set was assembled from several bioactivity measurement units including (in order of decreasing data
103 size) IC50, Ki, % activity, % inhibition, MIC, EC50, MIC etc. MIC was selected for further investigation as they constituted the largest subset with 25969 compounds.
