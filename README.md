Here we have raw and screened Mtb data with Bioactivity, collected fro m ChEMBL

# FOR Mtb ONLY

## Data set
A dataset of inhibitors against Mtb (Target ID CHEMBL360) were compiled from the ChEMBL database that is comprised a total number of 88,284 compounds and 169144 bioactivity data points. The initial data set was assembled from several bioactivity measurement units including (in order of decreasing data
103 size) IC50, Ki, % activity, % inhibition, MIC, EC50, MIC etc. MIC was selected for further investigation as they constituted the largest subset with 25968 compounds. Only data points having nM as the bioactivity unit were selected for further study, which produced 12339 compounds (remove compounds with no SMILE data and no MIC value)
Furthermore, redundant compounds having different activity values were kept if the standard deviation of MIC was less than 2 and this resulted in 4329 compounds.
