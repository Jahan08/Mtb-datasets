
bioactivity_data_Mtb_raw_data.csv has all bioactive data

bioactivity_data_MIC.csv has only MIC data

bioactivity_preprocessed_data_Mtb_MIC_nM .csv has only nM MIC data 

bioactivity_preprocessed_data_Mtb_nodup_MIC_nM.csv has MIC with merging duplicate compounds

Mtb_MIC_nm_MolDes.csv -> in this file we consider MIC <= 10000 nM active and MIC >= 50000 nM inactive, which can be changed later

This developed after removing NAN data and merge the duplicate compounds with Lipniski's molecular descriptors

Mtb_pMIC_MolDes_nM.csv has MIC has negative logarithm pMIC values
